# Python scripts for remote sensing
This repository contains some useful python scripts for working with multispectral raster data (e.g. Sentinel, Landsat.....). The used modules are all open-source.

## Running the scripts
If all the dependencies are installed, the scripts run in any python environment. The next section provides some steps to create a python runtime on your machine.

### Create a python environment to run the scripts
There are many ways to create a python environment on your machine. Therefore, the following one is just one of many options.
* Download [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/) from [https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/). <br />Make sure to download the community edition which is free and open-source.
* Install the downloaded package on your machine
* If you have installed Git on your machine you can clone this repository by typing ```git clone ```
